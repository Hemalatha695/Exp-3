# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To develop the Online Ticket Reservation System using Star UML tool.
# SRS (Procedure):
1.A Ticket Reservation System is a computerized system designed to manage ticket booking and reservation processes for various modes of transport such as buses, trains, and flights. It replaces traditional manual ticketing with a fast, accurate, and reliable digital process.

The system allows users to check the availability of seats, view schedules, and book or cancel tickets online. It offers advantages such as time efficiency, accuracy, and convenience, while also reducing paperwork and human error in the ticketing process.

Registered users can easily log in to the system, select their desired destination, date, and time of travel, and make secure online payments. After a successful transaction, the system automatically generates an E-Ticket that can be saved, printed, or accessed digitally at any time.

The admin panel allows administrators to manage routes, schedules, ticket prices, and seat allocations. The system updates data in real time, ensuring that customers always see the latest information on available tickets and timings.

The system can also send notifications such as booking confirmations, cancellation details, and schedule updates via email or SMS, making it highly user-friendly and responsive.

Overall, the Ticket Reservation System improves customer satisfaction and operational efficiency by providing a secure, flexible, and eco-friendly way to reserve tickets. It saves time, reduces cost, and supports a modern, paperless approach to travel management.
